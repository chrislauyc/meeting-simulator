## The Problem

- Video conference has transformed and brought the workplace online. Even though video conference has provided a lot of convenience, it is far from perfect at substituting in-person meetings

- Some of the things lacking are:
    - A physical space to interact with each other
    - Allowing multiple conversations between different people in a meeting

## Product Vision

To the solve the challenges above, I listed these goals: 

- The goal is to build a game-like environment for a meeting/gathering to walk around a virtual space and video chat with people within their proximity

## Minimum Viable Product

- The meeting room should allow people to move their character around
- Join conversations by simply moving close other people's characters and leave by moving away
- The meeting room should support multiple simultaneous conversations

## Features Needed

- User authentication
- Interface built using MelonJS
- Video chat built using webrtc protocol


## Dependencies

Frontend
- MelonJS
- socket.io (webrtc)

Backend
- express
